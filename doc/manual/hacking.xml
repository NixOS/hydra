<title>Hacking</title>

<para>This section provides some notes on how to hack on Hydra.  To
get the latest version of Hydra from GitHub:
<screen>
$ git clone git://github.com/NixOS/hydra.git
$ cd hydra
</screen>
</para>

<para>To build it and its dependencies:
<screen>
$ nix-build release.nix -A build.x86_64-linux
</screen>
</para>

<para>To build all dependencies and start a shell in which all
environment variables (such as <envar>PERL5LIB</envar>) are set up so
that those dependencies can be found:
<screen>
$ nix-shell
</screen>
To build Hydra, you should then do:
<screen>
[nix-shell]$ ./bootstrap
[nix-shell]$ configurePhase
[nix-shell]$ make
</screen>
You can run the Hydra web server in your source tree as follows:
<screen>
$ ./src/script/hydra-init
$ ./src/script/hydra-create-user dev --role admin --password notthatsafe
$ ./src/script/hydra-server
</screen>
</para>

<para>To evaluate a jobset locally and to build the queued jobs,
the corresponding tools can be called directly from <literal>nix-shell</literal>
if everything was built before:
<screen>
[nix-shell]$ ./src/hydra-evaluator/hydra-evaluator # Ctrl-C as soon as your evaluation finished
[nix-shell]$ ./src/hydra-queue-runner/hydra-queue-runner
</screen>
</para>
