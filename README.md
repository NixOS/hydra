# Hydra

[![CI](https://github.com/NixOS/hydra/workflows/Test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/NixOS/hydra/actions)

Hydra is a [Continuous Integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) service for [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix) based projects.

## Installation And Setup

**Note**: The instructions provided below are intended to enable new users to get a simple, local installation up and running. They are by no means sufficient for running a production server, let alone a public instance.

### Enabling The Service
Running Hydra is currently only supported on NixOS. The [hydra module](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/release-20.03/nixos/modules/services/continuous-integration/hydra/default.nix) allows for an easy setup. The following configuration can be used for a simple setup that performs all builds on _localhost_ (Please refer to the [Options page](https://nixos.org/nixos/options.html#services.hydra) for all available options):

```nix
{
  services.hydra = {
    enable = true;
    hydraURL = "http://localhost:3000";
    notificationSender = "hydra@localhost";
    buildMachinesFiles = [];
    useSubstitutes = true;
  };
}
```
### Creating An Admin User
Once the Hydra service has been configured as above and activate you should already be able to access the UI interface at the specified URL. However some actions require an admin user which has to be created first:

```
$ su - hydra
$ hydra-create-user <USER> --full-name '<NAME>' \
    --email-address '<EMAIL>' --password <PASSWORD> --role admin
```

Afterwards you should be able to log by clicking on "_Sign In_" on the top right of the web interface using the credentials specified by `hydra-crate-user`. Once you are logged in you can click "_Admin -> Create Project_" to configure your first project.

### Creating A Simple Project And Jobset
In order to evaluate and build anything you need to crate _projects_ that contain _jobsets_. Hydra supports imperative and declarative projects and many different configurations. The steps below will guide you through the required steps to creating a minimal imperative project configuration.

#### Creating A Project
Log in as adminstrator, click "_Admin_" and select "_Create project_". Fill the form as follows:

- **Identifier**: `hello`
- **Display name**: `hello`
- **Description**: `hello project`

Click "_Create project_".

#### Creating A Jobset
After creating a project you are forwarded to the project page. Click "_Actions_" and choose "_Create jobset_". Fill the form with the following values:

- **Identifier**: `hello`
- **Nix expression**: `examples/hello.nix` in `hydra`
- **Check interval**: 60
- **Scheduling shares**: 1

We have to add two inputs for this jobset. One for _nixpkgs_ and one for _hydra_ (which we are referrencing in the Nix expression above):

- **Input name**: `nixpkgs`
- **Type**: `Git checkout`
- **Value**: `https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs-channels nixos-20.03`

- **Input name**: `hydra`
- **Type**: `Git checkout`
- **Value**: `https://github.com/nixos/hydra`

Make sure **State** at the top of the page is set to "_Enabled_" and click on "_Create jobset_". This concludes the creation of a jobset that evaluates [./examples/hello.nix](./examples/hello.nix) once a minute. Clicking "_Evaluations_" should list the first evaluation of the newly created jobset after a brief delay.

## Building And Developing

### Building Hydra

You can build Hydra via `nix-build` using the provided [default.nix](./default.nix):
```
$ nix-build
```

### Development Environment

You can use the provided shell.nix to get a working development environment:
```
$ nix-shell
$ ./bootstrap
$ configurePhase # NOTE: not ./configure
$ make
```

### JSON API

You can also interface with Hydra through a JSON API. The API is defined in [hydra.yaml](./hydra.yaml) and you can test and explore via the [swagger editor](https://editor.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NixOS/hydra/master/hydra-api.yaml)
